# Intent Kit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Intent-First Development
Every feature begins with a clear, unambiguous statement of intent. Intent specifications define **what** users need and **why**, without specifying **how** to implement. Implementation details emerge from intent, not the other way around.

### II. AI-Augmented Workflow
AI agents are powerful collaborators, not autonomous systems. Human oversight, judgment, and decision-making remain essential throughout the development process. AI suggestions are validated, refined, and approved by human developers.

### III. Quality Through Structure
Quality emerges from structured processes, not from individual brilliance. Every project follows the Intent-Driven Development methodology: Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement, with clarification and analysis as needed.

### IV. Testability as Foundation
Every requirement must be independently testable. User stories are prioritized by business value and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.

### V. Transparency and Documentation
All decisions, assumptions, and trade-offs are documented. Specifications are written for business stakeholders. Technical decisions include clear rationale. The development process is visible and understandable to all participants.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- **Readability over cleverness**: Code should be understandable by developers of varying experience levels
- **Consistency over perfection**: Follow established patterns and conventions within each project
- **Simplicity over complexity**: Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- **Maintainability over optimization**: Write code that can be easily modified and extended

### Testing Standards
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation when practical
- **Independent testability**: Each user story must be testable in isolation
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Test both happy paths and edge cases
- **Automated validation**: Use automated tests to prevent regressions

### Documentation Standards
- **User-focused**: Documentation serves end users and stakeholders first
- **Developer-friendly**: Include technical details needed for maintenance and extension
- **Current and accurate**: Documentation reflects the current state of the system
- **Accessible**: Use clear language and provide examples

## Technology Philosophy

### Appropriate Technology Selection
- **Fit over fashion**: Choose technologies that solve the actual problem
- **Maturity over novelty**: Prefer proven solutions over bleeding-edge technologies
- **Integration over isolation**: Consider how new components fit into the existing ecosystem
- **Evolution over revolution**: Plan for gradual improvement rather than wholesale replacement

### Architecture Principles
- **Separation of concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Dependency management**: Minimize coupling between components
- **Interface design**: Design clean, stable interfaces between systems
- **Performance consideration**: Plan for scale from the beginning

## Process Governance

### Decision Making
- **Principle-based**: All decisions must align with the constitution
- **Documented rationale**: Technical choices include clear justification
- **Stakeholder involvement**: Include relevant stakeholders in significant decisions
- **Reversible when possible**: Prefer reversible decisions over permanent commitments

### Quality Gates
- **Specification completeness**: All requirements are clear and testable
- **Plan validation**: Technical approach is feasible and appropriate
- **Implementation review**: Code meets quality and security standards
- **Testing validation**: All tests pass and cover critical functionality

### Communication Standards
- **Clear intent**: All communication focuses on outcomes, not implementation details
- **Regular updates**: Keep stakeholders informed of progress and challenges
- **Issue resolution**: Address problems promptly and transparently
- **Knowledge sharing**: Document solutions for future reference

## Project Lifecycle

### Initiation
- **Clear scope**: Define what success looks like before starting
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Ensure all parties understand goals and constraints
- **Resource planning**: Identify required skills, tools, and time
- **Risk assessment**: Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies

### Development
- **Iterative progress**: Deliver value incrementally when possible
- **Quality focus**: Maintain standards throughout development
- **Adaptation**: Be willing to adjust plans based on new information
- **Validation**: Continuously verify that work meets requirements

### Completion
- **Acceptance criteria**: Verify that all success criteria are met
- **Knowledge transfer**: Ensure maintainers understand the system
- **Handoff documentation**: Provide necessary information for ongoing support
- **Retrospective**: Learn from the experience for future improvements

## Amendment Process

This constitution may be amended when:
- **New principles are needed**: To address gaps in current guidance
- **Existing principles need clarification**: To resolve interpretation issues
- **Technology landscape changes**: To adapt to significant technological shifts
- **Process improvements identified**: To incorporate lessons learned

### Amendment Requirements
- **Clear rationale**: Explain why the change is needed
- **Impact assessment**: Describe how the change affects existing projects
- **Migration plan**: Provide guidance for updating existing work
- **Stakeholder approval**: Include relevant parties in the decision

## Enforcement

This constitution is a living document that guides but does not constrain. When conflicts arise:
- **Principles over expediency**: Choose approaches that align with core principles
- **Discussion over assumption**: Talk through disagreements openly
- **Documentation over memory**: Record decisions and rationale
- **Learning over blame**: Use conflicts as opportunities to improve
