# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Template Version**: 2.0
**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language. Focus on what the user wants to achieve, not how the system will implement
it. Keep it concise yet comprehensive.]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level. Consider business impact, user pain points,
technical dependencies, and regulatory requirements.]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action]
and delivers [specific value]. This test should verify that the user story provides standalone value without requiring
other stories."]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
3. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

it. Keep it concise yet comprehensive.]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level. Consider business impact, user pain points,
technical dependencies, and regulatory requirements.]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently. This test should verify that the user story provides
standalone value without requiring other stories.]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
